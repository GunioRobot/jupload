V 2.2.5

Bugs corrected:
- The upload would fail when there are less files to upload than nbFilesPerRequest 
(NullPointerException in  FileUploadThreadV3)
- The stringUploadSuccess was not read from the applet parameters.

Changes:
- Add of the German language, thanks to Dr. Zoidberg.
- The method isUploadReady is now removed from FileData.
- A new 'advanced_jd_demo.html' page allows a newcomer to check the effect of all parameters on the applet.

V 2.2.4

Bugs corrected:
- NullPointerException (in FilePanelDataModel2 and in PictureFileData) because of the suppression of static methods 
in UploadPolicyFactory.

Changes:
- Java samples updated. They should be clean now. They use the last jakarta commons fileupload package.


V 2.2.3

Bugs corrected:
- Samples were bugguy: wrong URL, missing 'MAYSCRIPT' in the applet tags, which causes JSException
- minor bug: UploadPolicyFactory contains erroneous static getCurrentUploadPolicy, which would cause unpredictale 
result when several instances of the applet exist in memory

Enhancement:
- Upload policies can now 'refuse' a file added by the user. For instance, PictureUploadPolicy accepts only picture 
files (see createFileData).
- Sample now separate all uploaded files. This was already coded by William (creator of jupload), but not used by the 
sample.
- (minor) PictureFileData now correctly handles the isPicture internal variable.


V 2.2.0

  This version is a major release of jupload. It is based on the 'juploadV20040415R2' package. It adds the following 
functionnalities:
  
- Picture management. The applet is now able to:
  - Preview pictures,
  - Resize picture, to a maximum width and/or height before upload (this lower the network traffic, and can prevent 
the server to transform picture after upload)
  - Display a full screen picture (by clicking on the previewed picture),
  - Rotate the picture right or left,
  - Download pictures and select the upload album on the same web page (with the jupload.php script),
  - Upload all pictures/files in one click,
- UploadPolicy allows easy configuration of the the applet behaves (see below for the current list of parameters), 
- Multi-language.

Here are the current parameters allows that the upload policies allows to control. All details are given in the javadoc:
- uploadPolicy
- postURL
- debugLevel
- lang
- urlToSendErrorTo
- nbFilesPerRequest
- serverProtocol
- stringUploadSuccess
- maxPicHeight
