<H1>How to get suppport ?</H1>

<H2>Where asking for support ? </H2>
Please, use the forums available on <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jupload/">sourceforge</a>. It's the 
easiest way to check that every question has an answer. The <a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=199107">help</a>
when you need help, or the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=199106">open discussion</a> for 
other threads. You'll find a text area at the end of these pages.
<BR>
I'll receive a mail when any new message is sent to te sourceforge's forums. So emailing-me won't provide you a 
quicker response.
<BR>
And other people could also help you.
