- Integrate the proposal in the 'Trying to Add Upload Path via Javascript'
http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=2107422&forum_id=199107

- Check compiling on a fresh eclipse install, with the given build.xml
  (see http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=2048291&forum_id=199107).
- Debug file output: should be enabled only in debug mode.
- Check the wiki
- Depending on the camera configuration, metadata coming from Canon (10D, 20D, 30D) may not work with picture 
resizing: colors of the picture resized are wrong. Prevent transmition of metadata, with the pictureTransmitMetadata 
parameter corrects the problem: there is a big in the SUN JRE.
==> This is a Java bug.
- Add (at least) a link to the sample in http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1807811&forum_id=199107
- Allows upload from the demo site, or inform that it doesn't work.
- Picture mode: implement target picture format (to be changed to another name ?)
- Picture mode: applet parameter to control the size of the preview on the file chooser.
- Restore compatibility with standard Java application (it currently only works as an applet).
- Remove support for the deprecated applet parameter filenameEncoding.
- Also upload empty sub-directories (must be conditioned by a new applet parameter).
