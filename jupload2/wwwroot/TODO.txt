
As always, a lot of things can be made better:

TODO list:
- Error copied in the clipboard
	Pas mal. Mais Coppermine log qc après le copier dans le presse-papier
- Check the specificHeaders doc, in the howtocustomize page. \\n to n after packaging ?
- Enable compression
- Check with 4000 empty files.
	=> OutOfMemory. The correction is quite heavy. Will be done.
- Add a new parameter, to control the current applet directory, that is: the directory that should be used
when first clicking on the 'Browse' button.

- Check all printStackTrace calls in the code

- Integrate the proposal in the 'Trying to Add Upload Path via Javascript'
http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=2107422&forum_id=199107

- Manage the Paste, to allow pasting files onto the applet.
- Check compiling on a fresh eclipse install, with the given build.xml
  (see http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=2048291&forum_id=199107).
- Debug file output: should be enabled only in debug mode. Also: could be nice to have some more entries in the
debug menu: paste debug output, open debug file... 
- Check the wiki
- Close file (see UploadFileData.getInputStream()) just after upload, and not when all files have been uploaded. 
Currently: uploading 1000 files in one HTTP request leads to a 'too many files open' error. 
- Check that files are correctly closed during upload (uploading 1000 files leads to a 'too many files open' error).
- Depending on the camera configuration, metadata coming from Canon (10D, 20D, 30D) may not work with picture 
resizing: colors of the picture resized are wrong. Prevent transmition of metadata, with the pictureTransmitMetadata 
parameter corrects the problem: there is a big in the SUN JRE. TODO: make a sample, and create defect for SUN.
- Picture mode: use the JMF and Java Advanced Image I/O
- All error should result in a question to the user: do you want to send the error log?
- Add (at least) a link to the sample in http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1807811&forum_id=199107
- Allows upload from the demo site, or inform that it doesn't work.
- Picture mode: implement target picture format (to be changed to another name ?)
- Picture mode: applet parameter to control the size of the preview on the file chooser.
- Restore compatibility with standard Java application (it currently only works as an applet).
- Remove support for the deprecated applet parameter filenameEncoding.
- Also upload empty sub-directories (must be conditioned by a new applet parameter).
