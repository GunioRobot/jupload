<H1>How to debug this applet ?</H1>

<H2>Display/storage of the debug message</H2>

The UploadPolicy contains a displayDebug method. This method :
<DIR>
  <LI><U>Displays the message on the status bar</U> (on the bottom of the applet), <U>if the current debugLevel is greater or
  equals to the level given to this method</U>. To have no debug output, put this applet parameter to 0 ... or don't put
  aby debugLevel to it, as 0 is the default level. 100 is the maximum debugLevel. As I didn't documente nor really 
  manage the different values of this level... Let's say you may have 0 or 100 (debug off or on).
  <LI><U>Store the given message in a BufferString</U>, whatever the current debugLevel is.
</DIR>

<H2>Getting the debug output</H2>
The code contains a lot of calls to the dsiaplyDebug method. To get the output generated by these calls:
<DIR>
  <LI>If you are <U>in debug mode</U>, you can copy the full status area, to get the full debug output.
  <LI>If not, and you've given the <U>urlToSendErrorTo</U> applet parameter. Then, the applet will propose to send the full
  debug output, stored in its StringBuffer, to this URL, by an HTTP POST. This allows you to log the error, send a mail
  to the webmaster...
</DIR>

<H2>Changing the debug level</H2>

There are two ways to do this:
<DIR>
  <LI><U>Change the server configuration</U>: give the debugLevel applet parameter, in the applet tag. Put this parameter 
  to 100, to get the full debug output.
  <LI><U>Change the applet configuration, once it is started</U> (since 2.5). I've hidden this functionnality, to prevent 
  user to activate this by error. Here is the way to activate the full debug output: Right-Click on the status area, 
  while holding the CTRL key down. This should open a popmenu: select the 'debug on' entry. Doing so switch the debug 
  on and off.
</DIR>
