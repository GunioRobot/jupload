<P>This directory contains the translation stuff for JUpload. JUpload is used for two main open source developpement:</P>
<DIR>
<LI> The applet itself. It is contained in the jupload sourceforge project.<BR>
  See http://sourceforge.net/projects/jupload/
<LI> A plugin for Coppermine, based on this applet. Coppermine is a nice picture gallery.
<DIR>
  <LI>For more information on Coppermine: <a href="http://www.coppermine-gallery.net">http://www.coppermine-gallery.net</A>
  <LI>For more information on the JUpload plugin for Coppermine: 
  <a href="http://forum.coppermine-gallery.net/index.php/board,100.0.html">http://forum.coppermine-gallery.net/index.php/board,100.0.html</a>
</DIR></DIR>

<P>So the translation part also contains two parts:</P>
<OL> 
<LI>The text for the applet itself. This text is embedded into the applet source. It's a java property file, 
filled with lines like:
  property = the translated text
<LI>The text for the PHP part, specific to the JUpload Coppermine plugin. It's a PHP file, that fills an array. 
It contains an array initialization, like this:
<PRE>
	$lang_jupload_php = array_merge (
		$lang_jupload_php,
		array(
		  'link_comment' => 'Upload files to the gallery, with the help of an applet',
		  ...
		)
	);
</PRE>
</OL>


<H2><A name="HowToTranslate">2) HOWTO TRANSLATE</A></H2>

<P><B>For all translaters:</B>
<U>Please also check/translate the Coppermine part</U>, even if you don't use it. This will allow the plugin to be used by more and more people.
</P> 

<P>The list of existing translations is <A href="translation/generated/available_translations.html">available here</A>.</P>
  
<H3>Where are the files ?</H3>

<P>The files are stored in the text subdirectory:</P>
<DIR>
<LI>text/applet contains the text for the applet itself
<LI>text/CopperminePlugin contains the text for the Coppermine part.
</DIR>

<H3>File encoding</H3>

<P>To allow an easier management of characters specific to each languages (accents...), <U><B>files are stored in UTF-8</B></U>. </P>

<H3>How to publish a new translation</H3>
 
<OL>
	<LI>Please <B>keep this UTF-8</B> file encoding.
	<LI>Get the applet English text here:
		<A href="http://jupload.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/jupload/trunk/jupload2/wwwroot/translation/translation.utf-8/applet/lang_en.properties">lang_en.properties</A>     
	<LI><U>Please also translate/check the Coppermine translation</U>, even if you don't use it. You can get the last version here:
		<A href="http://jupload.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/jupload/trunk/jupload2/wwwroot/translation/translation.utf-8/CopperminePlugin/english.php">english.php</A>     
	<LI>To avoid any problem with character encoding, the easiest way is to save file as an RTF document.     
	<LI>Get the last English translation for the two files below, translate them, and send them to   
		<a href="mailto:etienne_sf@sourceforge.net?subject=Jupload translation">my sourceforge mail address</a>
</OL>


<H2><A name="buildScript">3) HOW DOES THE TRANSLATION build.xml SCRIPT WORKS</A></H2>


<P>All the material for JUpload translation is stored, in the /wwwroot/translation folder. This contains:</P>
<DIR>
	<LI>The applet translation text.
	<LI>The JUpload plugin for Coppermine text.
	<LI>The build.xml script, that get the translated from theses directories, and publish them in the target folder. <B>This script is called 
	by the main build script</B>. It works this way:
	<DIR>
		<LI>Applet text: 
		<DIR>
			<LI>Is converted from UTF-8, by a call to the native2ascii java utilities
			<LI>The converted file is publish to the /src/wjhk/jupload2/lang folder
			<LI>Thanks to SVN capabilities, the file will be noted as changed only if the file content actually changed. 
			This means that the build file can be run any number of time, without any impact, if no change occured. 
		</DIR>
		<LI>CopperminePlugin text:
		<DIR>
			<LI>This part of the job is done, only if <I>$coppermine.lang.folder</I> is defined. It has no 
			default value. This means that, by default, no action is done for CopperminePlugin text.
			<LI>These files are kept in UTF-8,
			<LI>They are published in the folder identified by the <I>$coppermine.lang.folder</I>
		</DIR>
