TODO list:
- Allows upload from the demo site, or inform that it doesn't work.


V3.0.0rc1

Translations:
- [Danish] Add of the Danish translation, thanks to Jeppe Bundsgaard.
- [Russian] Russian translation has been given by TO BE COMPLETED.


V2.9.2

Changes:
- [Minor/pictureMode] Temporary files are now created by File.createTempFile. They are removed by the end of the JVM, even if
debugLevel>=100. No more pollution of the picture directory.

Bug correction:
- [Minor] The lookAndFeel aapplet parameter was uncorrecty managed. Correction given by Fritz (sourceforge username)


V2.9.1

Changes:
- [Minor] The mime types is now set. The reference list is taken from http://www.mimetype.org/, thanks to them!

Translations:
- [Polish] Polish translation has been given by Wojtek Semik: wojteks at pvd dot pl
- [Slovenian] Slovenian translation has been given by Alenka Pirman and Damjan Leban: damjan dot leban at siol dot net

Bugs correction:
- [Major] The applet would not resize a picture that has been previewed in the applet. This file could then remain
bigger than maxFileSize, and not be uploaded.



V2.9.0

Changes:
- [FTP Upload] Thanks to Evin Callahan, you can now put FTP URL in the postURL parameter. The files will be uploaded to any kind of FTP 
server (anonymous or not).
- [Internal Code] A new DefaultUploadThreadV5 is created. This should help to create new upload behaviours, for instance
SMTP upload (to send files by email) or Samba upload (to send files on a local network, in intranet configuration). Just 
inherit from it, and implement the few fabstract methods defined in DefaultUploadThreadV5.
- [Minor] It's now possible to select multiple files in the file list, to remove several files, for instance.

Languages:
- [Chinese] A chinese translation is now available, thanks to Liu (Fbo ?)
- [Bresilian - Portugese] A Bresilian translation, is available, thanks to Frederico Ronfaut Klein. I copied this file 
to also give a first Portugese translation. I don't know the differences between Portugese and Bresilian...
- [Norwegian] Updated translation, thanks to Pal Knudsen.

New parameters / setProperty method:
- [setProperty] The applet setProperty method allows to change any applet parameter from the javascript on the web page.
This allows, for instance, to change the postURL or afterUploadURL parameters according to value selected by the user
on the web page.
- [showStatusBar] Thanks to XXXXXXXXXXX, a new applet parameter (showStatusBar) allows to hide the status bar. This
status bar will remain visible, if debugLevel is > 0 (or if debug is activated while the applet is running. You can 
now put the debug on, by CTRL+right click on both the status bar or the file list. If debug is on, the showSatusBar 
parameter is ignored.
- [afterUploadURL] If this parameter is set, the applet will redirect the current web page to this
URL. This allows the application to view the uploaded files, and entre comments, for instance.
- [realMaxPicWidth, realMaxPicHeight] Add of the realMaxPicWidth and realMaxPicHeight. This allows you to better control when the applet
will generate a new picture file: these parameters allow you to prevent any picture work from the applet, when 
uploading a picture that doesn't need to be transformed (-> speed up of upload time).
- [allowedFileExtensions] Allows the caller to specify a list of file extensions.


Bug Corrected:
- [Boolean] Default value for boolean parameter were inverted (false to true, and true to false).

V2.8.0

Main change:
- [Upload] The applet is now able of splitting the file to upload in chunks. This allow to upload file of any size, 
whatever the max_upload_size of your server is.

Changes:
- [Translation] Add of the Japanese translation.
- [Translation] Add of the Norwegian translation.
- The following methods have been added to the applet. They directly call the relevant method of the current upload
policy. Useful to display additional information from the HTML, in coordination with the urlToSendErrorTo applet
parameter. I use it to add to the status area the version of the HTML page that calls the applet. New functions 
are: displayErr, displayInfo, displayWarn and displayDebug.


V2.6.0

The next changes and corrections are given by David Gnedt:
- [New fuctionnality] SSL management. You can now upload files with JUpload in SSL (HTTPS)!  Great!
- [Update] Better picture resizing: the use of BufferedImage.getScaledInstance() allows better picture quality, when 
resizing a picture. But it consumes more CPU and memory (see below the new applet parameter highQualityPreview)
- [Correction] When the picture file format should change, the applet would not do it if there where no rotation
or resizing.

Other changes:
- [Parameter] A new applet parameter: highQualityPreview. It allows the calculation of better preview picture. But
displaying the full screen preview is longer. On an old PII 500MHz and a 8,5M pixels picture, the full screen
picture is displayed in 12 seconds when highQualityPreview is set to true, instead of 5s when the parameter is not
set or set to false.



V2.5.0

Bugs Corrected:
- [Major] Corrected an important memory leak when viewing a fullscreen picture (by clicking on the preview picture). 
- [Minor] When previewing a picture in 'big' format (full screen), the size is now calculated only with the Window 
size, not with the maxPicWidth and maxPicHeight parameters.
- [Minor] Temporary files where not deleted, when using picture mode, and stopping the upload with the 'stop' button.
- [Minor] Correction of the howto-customise and the javadoc: a lot of applet parameters were not displayed in these html
files.


Changes:
- [Major] The applet has been tested, and runs well with only a little allocated memory: tested with a JVM of 
minMemory=8M and a maxMemory=16M.
- [Translation] Now translated in Esperanto, thanks to Chuck Smith (whiz.at.users.sourceforge.net)
- [Translation] Now translated in Dutch, thanks to Rob van Kempen (rob.at.vankempen.nu)
- [Major] Add of a popup menu that allows changing the debug mode while using the applet: very useful to help
debugging a problem on a distant server, with only a standard user access to the site. To switch the debug mode on: 
click on the right button, while holding the CTRL down.
- [Minor] (feature request nï¿½1625013) Add of a new applet parameter: lookAndFeel. It allows to control the way the 
applet is displayed. This allow to display the applet with a java look & feel, or to use the current user's system 
one, or any other. Please, take a look to the list of applet parameters, to use it.


V2.4.0

Bugs Corrected:
- It's now possible to use the 'stop' button to stop an upload. 
- It's no more possible to click on 'upload' during an upload, which could lead to unpredictable behaviour.
- In the given examples, the parse.jsp had the following bug, now corrected: no call to fileItem.delete(). Without it 
the heap server quickly runs out of memory.


Changes:
- for Picture uploads (PictureUploadPolicy and CoppermineUploadPolicy) Upload of pictures stored in a read-only 
directory won't block the upload anymore. The original file is send, without being resized or rotated.
- The Mime Type is now correct, but only for pictures (see PictureUploadPolicy and CoppermineUploadPolicy).
- Modified a test of the stringUploadSuccess applet parameter: if it's not found, a warning is now displayed. This
test seems to be buggy on a lot of various systems. But I could repeat the troubles on my server. Now, if the 
success string is not found, there is only a warning message.
- Add of a FileUploadThread interface, that will be manipulated by other packages. This will help creation of new
version of FileUploadThreadVn. The FileUploadThreadVn are the successive versions of these classes. I keep them, as 
people often update them for their needs.
- Add of a FileUploadThreadV4 and a UploadFileData. These class will help to implement further extension like _chunk_ 
(to send file piece per piece) or eaisier mark of upload error per file. The original FileUploadThread has been renamed into
FileUploadThreadV1 (of anyone stil use it). FileUploadThreadV1, FileUploadThreadV2 and FileUploadThreadV3 implement 
- Creation of a FileData interface. The default implementation is now into the DefaultFileData.

V2.3.1

Changes:
- Spanish translation available (thanks to jesusangelwork: jesusangelwork[at]users.sourceforge[dot]net)
- The UploadPolicy.getUploadFilename method has been renamed in getUploadName, to avoid error, as this is not the
filename. See the javadoc for all details. BE CAREFUL, if you create a new UploadPolicy, that a new getUploadFilename
has been created. This to allow future encoding of filenames (still work in progress)


V 2.3.0

Bugs corrected:
- The upload would fail when there are less files to upload than nbFilesPerRequest (NullPointerException 
in FileUploadThreadV3).
- The stringUploadSuccess was never read from the applet parameters.

Changes:
- Add of the German language, thanks to Dr. Zoidberg.
- UPLOAD CLASS IS DYNAMIC. You can now create your own UploadPolicy, and put the full class name (with its package) 
into the uploadPolicy parameter to the applet: the UploadPolicyFactory will create it. Ths constructor for UploadPolicy
must have one parameter: JUploadApplet. From this applet, the UploadPolicy can get any necessary parameter, like
the statusArea, where it can displays text to the user.
- A new 'advanced_jd_demo.html' page allows a newcomer to check the effect of all parameters on the applet.
- The UploadPolicy.afterUpload() parameters changed : filePanel has been removed (useless, as it can be retrieve with 
the applet reference, already known from the UploadPolicy, see its constructor).
- The files are now removed just after upload. This means that, for instance, when uploading file by file, the user 
can see the already removed files disappear from the list of files to upload. If a crash occurs, he can then retry
the upload, with the remaining files.

V 2.2.4

Bugs corrected:
- NullPointerException (in FilePanelDataModel2 and in PictureFileData) because of the suppression of static methods 
in UploadPolicyFactory.

Changes:
- Java samples updated. They should be clean now. They use the last jakarta commons fileupload package.


V 2.2.3

Bugs corrected:
- Samples were bugguy: wrong URL, missing 'MAYSCRIPT' in the applet tags, which causes JSException
- minor bug: UploadPolicyFactory contains erroneous static getCurrentUploadPolicy, which would cause unpredictale 
result when several instances of the applet exist in memory

Enhancement:
- Upload policies can now 'refuse' a file added by the user. For instance, PictureUploadPolicy accepts only picture 
files (see createFileData).
- Sample now separate all uploaded files. This was already coded by William (creator of jupload), but not used by the 
sample.
- (minor) PictureFileData now correctly handles the isPicture internal variable.


V 2.2.0

  This version is a major release of jupload. It is based on the 'juploadV20040415R2' package. It adds the following 
functionnalities:
  
- Picture management. The applet is now able to:
  - Preview pictures,
  - Resize picture, to a maximum width and/or height before upload (this lower the network traffic, and can prevent 
the server to transform picture after upload)
  - Display a full screen picture (by clicking on the previewed picture),
  - Rotate the picture right or left,
  - Download pictures and select the upload album on the same web page (with the jupload.php script),
  - Upload all pictures/files in one click,
- UploadPolicy allows easy configuration of the the applet behaves (see below for the current list of parameters), 
- Multi-language.

Here are the current parameters allows that the upload policies allows to control. All details are given in the javadoc:
- uploadPolicy
- postURL
- debugLevel
- lang
- urlToSendErrorTo
- nbFilesPerRequest
- serverProtocol
- stringUploadSuccess
- maxPicHeight
- PictureUploadPolicy
- maxPicWidth
- maxPicHeight
- targetPictureFormat
- albumId
- storeBufferedImage
