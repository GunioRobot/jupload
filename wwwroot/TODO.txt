TODO list:

- Language: add the following header in all generated files:
#
# CAUTION: ALL FILES IN THE src/wjhk/jupload/lang PACKAGE ARE __GENERATED__.
#
# THEIR CONTENT WILL BE REPLACED, IN THE NEXT EXECUTION OF THE /wwwroot/translation/build_translation.xml

Demo done. Response to send to the above forum.


During upload, howto prevent one error (or warning) message to be displayed for all pictures (eg: too big picture)
Principles:
- The message must always be displayed the first time.
- Each time the message is displayed, the user may choose :
	* [Default] Yes: go on with upload. Displays the same message the next time this error occurs (same Exception class).
	As this picture is not uploaded, it is not removed from the file list.
	* No:  go on with upload. Errors of the same kind (same Exception class) in the same upload, will be logged, but no
	message will be displayed to the user. As this picture is not uploaded, it is not removed from the file list.
	* Cancel: stop the upload here.  
- What to do next: If there are already uploaded files (TAKE CARE TO MULTI-THREADING HERE, WHAT TO DO WITH FILES THAT 
	ARE CURRENTLY BEING SENT), the applet should now ask to the user what to do:
	1) Consider already uploaded files are successfull upload, and validate these (can switch to afterUploadURL, and lost 
	the non uploaded files).
	2) Consider already uploaded files are successfull uploaded, and validate these (the afterUploadURL is called in another
	window, and there will be two windows with the application: one with the applet, containing the non uploaded files,
	and one with the afterUploadURL for correctly uploaded files
	3) Send a cancel message to the server, to make it ignore the uploaded files. This can't be managed on applet side,
	or it will make server implementation always have to manage this. So, this must be managed on server side only.
	Proposal: wherever the server stores the file data, it attach a 'temporary status' to it (can be in a database, or 
	by storing the uploaded files in some kind of temporary folders. The uploaded files will be 'validated' (transaction
	is commited) when the afterUploadURL is called by the applet. The server then knows that the upload is finished, and 
	can do whatever is needed for the application.
	4) Wait (the user does nothing). If the user does nothing (he's taking a coffee, because upload is too long...), the
	server may have some kind of timeout. If so, he must send a specific error message to the applet, when the user
	decide to choose yes (for instance) one hour latter... 




- Some improvement and remarks
https://sourceforge.net/projects/jupload/forums/forum/199106/topic/3489660
When the applet is configured to resize images before uploading then sometimes bigger images do not get resized. 
In such a case a popup message is displayed with the message that the image is too big to convert and will be uploaded as-is.
I have a few questions about this:
3) Is there a way to suppress this message? (if a user has a high res camera and wants to upload alot of photo's, clicking OK 
every time is annoying)
4) Is there a way to block uploads based on maximum image size AFTER client side conversion? This so i can block uploads if the 
images are too big to process server side (memory limits). So what i mean is this: applet (tries to) convert images to maxsize, 
after this is done, apply the check for maximum dimensions (and if too big do not upload, just like the maximum file size check).

Uploading an empty text file (niv1.txt) generates an error.
Bug n°: 2793404. Solved in 4.6.0. Answer to post.

- maxChunkSize should be set to MAX_INTEGER, when in FTP protocol.

- [Minor] Response to bug 2891909 (Picture 1px too small)
Need rewriting of the picture resizing code
See initScale(), and identification of rounding troubles. This code should manage differently widht and height.
First: repeat the problem.
Original Picture: 3296x2472
maxWidth=120
maxHeight=0
Resulting Picture: 119x90 (it should be: 120x90)

ImageHelper.java 4.5.0
198 // With number rounding, it can happen that width or
size
199 // became one pixel too big. Let's correct it.

231 // Due to rounded numbers, the resulting targetWidth or
232 // targetHeight
233 // may be one pixel too big. Let's check that.

- Improve log management. Separate all displayXxx method from UploadPolicy to something like LogPolicy.

- [Minor] Replace juploadContext by applet in the DefaultUploadPolicy.java comments.

- Generalize the use of httpUploadParameterName and httpUploadParameterType applet parameter to all upload data (md5, path...)

- Response to [Help] pngs: alpha-transparency lost
example: after uploading this pic 
http://picbite.com/image/66099ydqkk/ 
the alpha-transparency will be lost and the former transparent background appears black: http://picbite.com/image/66100jiujf/ 
I don't know what code is used internally to resize the picture and to detect alpha-transparency, but I had the same problem for our HTML upload, so here is what we do - maybe it helps: 
http://www.easy-share.com/1907277312/imageScaling.java 
this is based on the examples here: http://www.exampledepot.com/egs/java.awt.image/HasAlpha.html

- Try Cobertura
(docs in /Java)

- STOP button: problems in chunk upload.
Add a way to advertise the server, that the upload was stopped.

- Manage tiff pictures
See Feature request on sourceforge.

- The applet should not ask the user to send the error to urlToSendErrorTo, when there is a functional error
(e.g.: wrong file type, file too big...)

- In picture mode: The file size should be checked after file preparation
(would not block files of 3M, in my standard coppermine conf)

- Add a HowToOptimize page
(allowHttpPersistent, nbFilesPerRequest...)

- Make FTP upload (and HTTP?) work with space in the path

- Check if it's possible to make quicker the add of thousands of files.
Probably not possible... :-(

kB should by kilo bytes. Answer in 'Open Discussions'

- When the file filter contains too many file extensions, the browser window may be larger than the screen!
=> Add an option to display or not this list ?   Or automatically hide the list of file extensions, when they are too many.
Answer to Heroes, on Coppermine PM.

- BUG: mimetype works only when the extension is in lower case.

- BUG: relpathinfo not being set when dragging
https://sourceforge.net/tracker2/index.php?func=detail&aid=2529111&group_id=59144&atid=490053
The content of relpathinfo is not the same for dropped files and for files added by the file chooser.
Corrected (is Ok in 4.2.0)


- Finish automation (ant script), about translations.
=> Generated translation/generated/available_translations.html
   - Check %1, %2... parameters in translated text.
   - Check Maintainer
   - Complete the language, which is UTF-8 file is to rebuild.
=> Make a link to it from:
   - the doc
   - the main readme.


- When a file is too big, it could non-blocking, and up to the user to go on or not.
Suggestion from Michel Verstraeten, in https://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=2593046&forum_id=199106 

- Document the content of the HTTP post of the applet (folders...).

- Message incorrect (no 'wait for server response' when using the applet with Coppermine)
- What to do with NoAlertPolicy ?

- implement setUncaughtExceptionHandler for the uploading threads.

- Integrate the proposal in the 'Trying to Add Upload Path via Javascript'
http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=2107422&forum_id=199107

- Check compiling on a fresh eclipse install, with the given build.xml
  (see http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=2048291&forum_id=199107).
- Debug file output: should be enabled only in debug mode.
- Check the wiki
- Depending on the camera configuration, metadata coming from Canon (10D, 20D, 30D) may not work with picture 
resizing: colors of the picture resized are wrong. Prevent transmition of metadata, with the pictureTransmitMetadata 
parameter corrects the problem: there is a big in the SUN JRE.
==> This is a Java bug.
- Add (at least) a link to the sample in http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1807811&forum_id=199107
- Allows upload from the demo site, or inform that it doesn't work.
- Picture mode: implement target picture format (to be changed to another name ?)
- Picture mode: applet parameter to control the size of the preview on the file chooser.
- Restore compatibility with standard Java application (it currently only works as an applet).
- Remove support for the deprecated applet parameter filenameEncoding.
- Also upload empty sub-directories (must be conditioned by a new applet parameter).
