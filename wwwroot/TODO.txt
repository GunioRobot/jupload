//private static final double gB = 1024L * 1024L * 1024L; 
//private static final double mB = 1024L * 1024L; 
//private static final double kB = 1024L; 
private static final double kB = 1024L; 
private static final double mB = kB * 1000L; 
private static final double gB = mB * 1000L; 
 
While I read the discussion about MiB, etc., few systems I know of use such calculations in showing files size, so the values in JUpload didn't match the values people saw in their own folders/directories. And even less have I seen MiB as to reference megabytes in a listing. So we also changed the lang_us.properties entries: 
 
#unitGigabytes = GiB 
#unitMegabytes = MiB 
#unitKilobytes = KiB 
unitGigabytes = GB 
unitMegabytes = MB 
unitKilobytes = KB 


==> #

            A Java 1.5 or higher plugin is required to upload using this option.
Please use the standard web browser upload procedure below instead.
        	</applet>

For us to reproduce we need to:
1) Ensure no browser is running.
2) Start the browser and load the applet.
3) Click Browse.
4) Click select your C:\ drive or Desktop as long as there are several files
in there.
5) Click the File Details icon to show the files, mod times, file sizes, etc.
6) Click a column header, such as Size.

The list gets confused (some data is not even in the right columns) and is not
sorted correctly.  If you click the same (or different) column header a second
time, it sorts correctly and the data are in the correct columns.


==> Can't repeat it (on windows 2000, Java 1.6.0_07)

As always, a lot of things can be made better:

TODO list:
- Finish automation (ant script), about translations.
- Message incorrect (no 'wait for server response' when using the applet with Coppermine)
- What to do with NoAlertPolicy ?

- implement setUncaughtExceptionHandler for the uploading threads.

- Enable compression
- Add a new parameter, to control the current applet directory, that is: the directory that should be used
when first clicking on the 'Browse' button.

- Integrate the proposal in the 'Trying to Add Upload Path via Javascript'
http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=2107422&forum_id=199107

- Check compiling on a fresh eclipse install, with the given build.xml
  (see http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=2048291&forum_id=199107).
- Debug file output: should be enabled only in debug mode.
- Check the wiki
- Depending on the camera configuration, metadata coming from Canon (10D, 20D, 30D) may not work with picture 
resizing: colors of the picture resized are wrong. Prevent transmition of metadata, with the pictureTransmitMetadata 
parameter corrects the problem: there is a big in the SUN JRE.
==> This is a Java bug.
- Add (at least) a link to the sample in http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1807811&forum_id=199107
- Allows upload from the demo site, or inform that it doesn't work.
- Picture mode: implement target picture format (to be changed to another name ?)
- Picture mode: applet parameter to control the size of the preview on the file chooser.
- Restore compatibility with standard Java application (it currently only works as an applet).
- Remove support for the deprecated applet parameter filenameEncoding.
- Also upload empty sub-directories (must be conditioned by a new applet parameter).
